<!-- Past Mission -->

    <h2 class="text-center">PAST MISSIONS</h2>
    <h6 class="text-center">Shelter homes</h6>
    <p>In the year 2005, HIVE established a shelter home to elevate the lifestyle and socio economic status of HIV affected women, stigmatized by the community, family and self. Called as Cornerstone project, this program was dedicated to equip women with self confidence in their personal and career life, to provide with temporary accommodation, food, medication along with moral and emotional support, to promote leadership qualities and to improve their skills in career and social life.
        In the year 2006, HIVE established an orphanage called HIVE Blossoms. This project started to help enhance the growth and healthy lifestyle of downtrodden, orphan, and children of terminally ill parents. Around 65 children were provided with quality education (Private English-medium schools) and eminent livelihood. In the year 2013, both orphanages were shut down due to lack of financial and human resources.
